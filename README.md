## Third Party 5% Threshold

Many say that a third party vote is impractical because a third party has no chance of winning the presidential election.

However, this doesn't take into account the **5% popular vote threshold**. If a third party gets 5% of the popular vote, that third party becomes a minor party.

Minor parties receive government matching funds. This would throw a wrench into the two major parties for the next election. We would now have a three party system. This would increase competition amongst the parties leading to higher innovation and accountability.

This chart shows the effect your vote has on the third party threshold if you vote third party vs the effect your vote has on the presidential outcome if you vote for a major party.
